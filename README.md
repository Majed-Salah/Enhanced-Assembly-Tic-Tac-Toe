# Enhanced-Assembly-Tic-Tac-Toe
A modified version of tic tac toe using x86 assembly and the Irvine library

This code relies on the irvine library, which can be downloaded via the following link: http://asmirvine.com/gettingStartedVS2017/index.htm

The code generates an ASCII tic-tac-toe table. The game is point based. Every 3 in a row gives 1 point to that player, and if there is more than 3 in a row either vertically, diagonally, or horizontally, it adds 1 extra point. For example, a 4 in a row awards 2 points and 5 in a row 3 points.

For the computer mode, the location of the marker is random; there is no AI or algorithm for placing any of the markers.
